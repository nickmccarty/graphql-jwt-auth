What other models/techniques can we employ?
============================

Knowing the interest in Neo4J and applications of graph theory and machine learning in the foreseeable future (to enhance our recommendation/inspiration engine, as fueled by user hashtags), our next steps will almost certainly involve the use of NLTK and WordNet in order to 1) aid in disambiguation of terms and 2) identify potentially helpful hypernyms, at the very least. If we want to keep it Python, NetworkX is a Neo4J alternative for network graphing.

In terms of our future data-labeling efforts, we can use:

1) AWS Mechanical Turk (suboptimal)
2) Snorkel (unstable?)
3) Prodi.gy (plays nicely with Jupyter ecosystem)

As for machine learning techniques, it is a bit premature to speculate on what we'll use.
